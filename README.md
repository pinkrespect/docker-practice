docker-practice
========
Docker image with both python 3.5 and mongodb 3.2.

### Instructions
```shell
# Build image
sudo docker build -t docker-practice .

# Run image
sudo docker run -it --rm --name docker-practice docker-practice
```

### Why would you do this? Why don't you separate those two to different containers?
